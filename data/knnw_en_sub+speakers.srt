2,Mitsuha
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,090
Some mornings, I wake up crying
without knowing why.

3,Mitsuha
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,440
That's when everything happens
now and again.

4,Taki
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,540
Whatever that dream was I had,
I can never remember it.

5,Taki+Mitsuha
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,550
- But...
- But...

6,Mitsuha
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,190
the only thing that
does last when I wake up

7, Mitsuha
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,190
is a sense of loss,

8, Mitsuha
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,190
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

9,Taki
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm always searching for something

10,Taki
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
or someone.

11,Mitsuha
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,090
Mitsuha: I've been consumed by this feeling...

12,Mitsuha
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,090
ever since that day.

13,Taki
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,910
Taki: The day... a star fell.

14,Taki
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,460
It was almost like...

15,Mitsuha
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,450
-like seeing something out of a dream.

16,Mitsuha
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,450
Nothing more or less...

17,Mitsuha+Taki
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,400
- than a breathtaking view.
- than a breathtaking view.

18,Band
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,430
Ah, if only our voices speak at night

19,Band
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,100
could ever reach the very
edge of this world

20,Band
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,610
and of time

21,Band
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,790
instead of fading into air and dust.

22,Band
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,840
Then what will the words, could it ever be

23,Band
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,540
farthest words from "probably"?

24,Band
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's make a promise that will never fade.

25,Band
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,830
Let's say it together on
the count of three, oh.

26,Band
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,960
Ah, I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard,

27,Band
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,730
but lately I've lost sight of
the truth in those words.

28,Band
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,980
I can't even remember when
I gave up believing.

29,Band
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,550
What could have been the reason?

30,Band
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,870
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop

31,Band
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,410
in the place rainbow born and dies.

32,Band
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,350
And where the end of this life lies,

33,Band
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,020
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for.

34,Band
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,990
One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored, unprecedented.

35,Band
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,720
We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time.

36,Band
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,380
The five dimensions keeps on teasing me,

37,Band
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,440
but I will keep on looking at you, dear.

38,Band
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,770
Let's make a sign for when we
say "nice to meet you" again.

39,Band
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm on my way to you,

40,Band
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,610
chasing after your name.

41,Mitsuha
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,140
Taki...

42,Mitsuha
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,890
Taki.

43,Mitsuha
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,900
Taki!

44,Mitsuha
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,270
Don't you remember?

45,Mitsuha
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,330
My name is...

46,Mitsuha
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,020
Mitsuha!

47,Yotsuha
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,010
Sis, what are you... doing?

48,Mitsuha
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,390
Whoa, they're so realistic-feeling...

49,Yotsuha
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,110
"Sis"?

50,Mitsuha
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,220
Me?

51,Yotsuha
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,880
Are you still asleep?

52,Yotsuha
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,010
Breakfast time, hurry up!

53,Mitsuha
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,050
Huh?

54,Mitsuha
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,420
Wha-?

55,Mitsuha
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,260
WHAAAT?!

56,Yotsuha
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,490
Do you wanna have any of
last night's fish, grandma?

57,Grandma
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,190
You can eat it.

58,Mitsuha+Grandma
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,210
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'!

59,Yotsuha
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,330
Lazy butt, you're so slow!

60,Mitsuha
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,540
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

61,Mitsuha
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,490
Oh, that's a lot...

62,Mitsuha
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,850
-Oh, well.

63,Grandma+Mitsuha
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,060
- You're back to normal today.
- Huh?

64,Yatsuha+Mitsuha
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,750
- You were so crazy yesterday.
- What do you mean, "crazy"?

65,Radio
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,380
-Attention, citizens of Itomori.

66,Radio
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,650
Good morning!

67,Radio
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,400
This is an official announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

68,Radio
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,330
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

69,Radio
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,390
The election will be held
on the 20th of next month.

70,Radio
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,240
The election committee would
like to remind everyone tha-

71,None
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,320
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

72,TV
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
A comet that comes only
once every 1,200 years

73,TV
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,770
will finally be headed our way in a month.

74,TV
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,120
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for
several days once it approaches the Earth...

75,Yotsuha
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,270
Just make up with him already, okay?

76,Mitsuha+TV
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,360
- That's an adult matter.
- According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're preparing for the celestial show of the millennium.

77,None
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,070

"Closest on October 4th"

79,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,120
- We're leaving!
- We're leaving!

80,Yotsuha
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,550
Yotsuha: I can't wait 'til the festival!
It's gonna be so much fun!

81,Yotsuha
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,570
Study hard, sis!

82,Saya
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,860
Ah!

83,Saya
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,420
Mitsuha!

84,Mitsuha  
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,370
Good mornin', Saya! Mornin', Teshi!

85,Saya+Teshi
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,040
- Mornin'!
- Come on, would you get off already?

86,Saya+Teshi
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,160
- What for, meanie?
- 'Cause you're heavy.

87,Saya+Mitsuha
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,360
- Hey, that's rude!
- Y'know, I gotta say. You two make a great couple.

88,Saya+Teshi
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,050
- No, we don't!
- No, we don't!

89,Mitsuha
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,930
Oh, I see you actually
bothered to do your hair today.

90,Mitsuha+Teshi
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,780
-Wait, what?
-Oh, yeah. What happened?
Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?

91,Mitsuha+Teshi
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,200
- Exorcise?
- Somethin' totally possessed your body!

92,Saya
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,190
Would you just give it a rest
with all this occult nonsense?

93,Saya+Mitsuha
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,660
- Mitsuha's gotta be feelin'
stressed enough as it is, right?
- What are you guys talking about?

94,Teshi
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Are you feelin' okay?

95,Toshiki
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,710
And above all, restoring the town's fiscal health
so we can continue our revitalization project.

96,Toshiki
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,610
It's only when all these things are achieved
that we can create a safe and secure community.

97,Toshiki+BystanderA
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,900
- As the incumbent, my administration...
- Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

98,BystanderB
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,270
I hear he's been dullin' out the pork.
Just between us.

99,StudentA+Mitsuha
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,450
- Hey, Miyamizu.
- Mornin'.

100,StudentA
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,650
Looks like the mayor and the
contractor's kid are pretty cozy, too.

101,Toshiki
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,790
-To improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

102,Toshiki+Mitsuha
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,540
- Mitsuha!
- [Gasp]

103,Toshiki
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,140
Stand up straight when you're walking!

104,BystanderC
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,510
Oh, he's tough on his family.

105,BystanderD
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,970
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

106,StudentB+StudentC
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,420
- Awkward.
- Sucks to be her.

107,Sara
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,140
Mitsuha!

108,Mitsuha
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,480
In front of everyone.

109,None
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,180

"Tasokare" [Twilight]

111,Teacher
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,010
"Two light." That's the
origin of the word twilight.

112,Teacher
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,770
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

113,Teacher
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,220
It's dusk, a time when
it's neither day nor night.

114,Teacher
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,690
When the border between worlds blur,

115,Teacher
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,670
and one might encounter
something not human.

116,Teacher
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,350
Another older term for it is dusk light.

117,Teacher
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,510
Some people also call it "golden hour".

118,None
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,210
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

119,StudentD
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,370
-What about "magic hour"?
It's something my grandma says.

120,Teacher
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,140
-Well, golden hour and magic
hour are technically the same,

121,Teacher
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,860
but it's a term that
mostly photographers use.

122,None
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,220
"Who are you?"

123,StudentD+Class
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,780
- Well, she does take a lot of pictures.
- [CLASS Laughing]

124,Teacher
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,980
-Okay, next...

125,Teacher+Mitsuha
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,330
- Miyamizu!
- Uh, yes?

126,Teacher
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, I can see that you
remember your own name today.

127,Class
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
[Laughing]

128,Saya+Mitsuha
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,660
Sayaka: You... don't remember?
Mitsuha: Uh-uh...

129,Sara
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

130,Sara
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,980
Plus, you had the worst case of bedhead,
and you didn't have your ribbon on, either!

131,Mitsuha
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,540
What?! No way!

132,Sara
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,190
Yeah, it was like you
had amnesia or somethin'.

133,Mitsuha
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,840
Now that you mention it, I do feel like
I've been havin' weird dreams lately.

134,Mitsuha
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,860
Like a dream about someone else's life?

135,Mitsuha
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,120
It's all so fuzzy.

136,Teshi
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,660
Wait a sec, I've got it...

137,Teshi
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,420
It's memories from a previous life,

138,Teshi
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,250
or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

139,Sara
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,570
Keep your full mouth shut!

140,Mitsuha
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,390
Wait a minute! Teshi, don't tell me you
were the one who wrote in my noteboo... k.

141,Mitsuha
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
Forget it.

142,Sara
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,500
But you really were actin' just a
little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

143,Sara
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,730
You been feelin' okay?

144,Mitsuha
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,450
That's what's weird. I feel fine.

145,Sara
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,600
Maybe it's from stress. You know, you've
got that ritual comin' up soon, don'tcha?

146,Mitsuha
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Ugh, don't remind me!

147,Mitsuha
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,380
I can't stand this place anymore!
It's too small and town-ey.

148,Mitsuha
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,870
I wanna graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

149,Sara
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,130
-Can't say I blame you. There really
is nothin' at all in this town.

150,Sara+Mitsuha
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,660
-There's only one train that stops here every two
hours -and all the stores close at nine o' clock.

151,Sara
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,770
No bookstores, no dentists,

152,None
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,940
"Mother's" "Cat's Eye Pub"

153,Mitsuha
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,140
but two cocktail lounges
for whatever reason.

154,Sara+Mitsuha
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,620
- No jobs in town.
- No one date-able.

155,Sara
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,230
Even the days are too short.

156,Teshi
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,470
You know what?!

157,Sara+Mitsuha
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,150
- No, what?
- No, what?

158,Teshi
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,500
Forget that stuff.
Why don't we go to a café?

159,Sara+Mitsuha
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,960
- A café?
- Really?

160,Sara+Mitsuha
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,260
- Where?!
- Where?!

161,BystanderD
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,800
Hello, kids!

162,Sara+Teshi
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
- Hi, there!
- Evenin', ma'am!

163,Sara+Teshi
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,740
- How is this a café?
- Like this town's got a café.

164,Sara
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,680
Mitsuha just went straight home.

165,Sara+Teshi
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,480
- Things have gotta be really
rough for her right now.
- She's on center stage and all.

166,Sara
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Yeah...

167,Sara+Teshi
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,440
- Hey, Teshi...
- Hm?

168,Sara
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,900
What are you gonna do after
you graduate high school?

169,Teshi
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,880
Where'd that come from?
You talkin' about the future?

170,Sara
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,370
Mh-hm.

171,Teshi
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,950
I dunno. I think I'll probably just end up
livin' in this town, y'know. Same as ever.

172,Yotsuha
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,940
I wanna do what you're doin'.

173,Grandma
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,850
It's still too soon for you to
try, Yotsuha.

174,Grandma
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,380
Listen to the thread's voice.

175,Grandma
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,880
When you twine it round and round like this, feelings
will start flowing between you and the thread.

176,Yotsuha+Mitsuha
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,950
- It's not like threads talk...
- She's telling you to focus.

177,Grandma
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,570
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

178,Grandma
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,620
Listen. Somethin' happened
two hundred years ago...

179,Mitsuha
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,040
Here she goes.

180,Grandma
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,170
The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki
caught on fire and this whole area burned down.

181,Grandma
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,650
The shrine and old
documents were destroyed.

182,Grandma+Mitsuha
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,070
- This is known as...
- Mayugoro's Great Fire.

183,Yotsuha
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,600
They named the fire after him?!
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

184,Grandma
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,150
The meaning behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

185,Grandma
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,740
Only the surface was left.

186,Grandma
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,040
But even if those words are
gone, those words shouldn't fade.

187,Grandma
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,530
That's the Miyamizu shrine's duty.
Our important task.

188,Grandma
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,830
Ugh...

189,Grandma
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,660
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine!

190,Grandma
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,360
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?!

191,Grandma
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,010
Oh, he's hopeless!

192,Toshiki
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,540
-Have another, mister foreman.

193,Toshiki+Foreman
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,390
- I'll be counting on your
help again for this election.
- Leave it to me.

194,Foreman
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,320
You'll get the votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts, guaranteed.

195,BackCharA+BackCharB
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,960
- How's the datin' scene?
- It ain't easy, that's for sure.

196,Teshi+TeshiMom
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,520
- Smells like corruption in there.
- What are you talkin' about?

197,Foreman+TeshiMom
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,280
- We're gonna need two
or three more bottles.
- Yes, dear.

198,Foreman
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,310
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help
out at the site this weekend.

199,Foreman+Teshi
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,520
- We'll be usin' explosives,
so you better study up.
- Grngh.

200,Foreman
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,580
What was that?!

201,Teshi
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Got it!

202,Teshi
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,930
Guess we both can't stand things here.

203,BystanderE
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,180
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

204,BystanderF
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,900
They're lookers, alright.
Just like their mother.

205,Teshi+Saya
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,520
- Heya!
- Hey.

206,Teshi
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,700
World's oldest kind of sake,

207,Teshi
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,660
but chewin' on rice, spittin' it out, and then
lettin' it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

208,Saya
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Kuchikamizake.

209,Saya
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,720
Do the gods really appreciate that.
The way it's ma-

210,Teshi
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,910
Yeah, of course they do!

211,StudentA
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,010
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

212,StudentB+StudentC
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:04,030
-Ugh! I'd never do that!
-And in front of everybody!
Embarrassing, right?

213,Yotsuha
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,870
You should try to cheer up, sis.

214,Yotsuha
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,010
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw that?

215,Mitsuha
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,940
It must be nice for you
not being a teenager.

216,Yotsuha
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, I know! You should just sell
Kuchikamizake and move to Tokyo!

217,Yotsuha
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,860
I bet you could sell it with all sorts of
stuff like photos and making-of videos.

218,Yotsuha
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh, and then you can call it "Shrine
Maiden's Sake"! You'll make buttloads!

219,None
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,890
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

220,Mitsuha
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,280
I can't! There are liquor laws!

221,Yotsuha
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,470
That's what you have a problem with?

222,Mitsuha
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,320
I hate this town! I hate this life, too!

223,Mitsuha
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,690
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

224,Yotsuha
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,770
Yotsuha: What a jackass.

225,Taki
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,820
Ow...

226,Taki
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,480
Where...?

227,Taki
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,260
Huh?

228,Taki
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,840
Hmm?

229,Taki
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,020
Something's... there...

230,Taki
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,040
Aaaah!

231,Taki
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
Eh!

232,TakiDad
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,840
Taki's Father: Taki, you up?

233,TakiDad
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,780
It was your turn to cook breakfast,
wasn't it? Did you sleep in?

234,Taki
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,690
I'm sorry.

235,TakiDad
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,040
Ugh, I'm heading out.

236,TakiDad+Taki
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,110
- Finish the miso.
- Uh, okay...

237,TakiDad
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,640
Make sure you go to school,
even if you're late. Seeya.

238,Taki
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,550
H-have a nice day.

239,Taki
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,860
What a strange dream...

240,Taki
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,300
[Gasp]

241,None
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,390
"From Tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

242,Taki
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,080
Huh? It's from "Tsukasa"?

243,Taki
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,990
Who's that? Hrm.

244,Taki
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,160
Uhhh...

245,Taki
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,660
I gotta go pee.

246,Taki
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,430
Way too real...

247,None
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
"Shinjuku Station"

248,Taki
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm in Tokyo!

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,690
"Jingu High School"

250,Crowd
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,840
- Where did you get this?
- Daikanyama.

251,Crowd
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Guess who's opening at our next gig?

252,Crowd
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,180
- W-wait wait, we have a gig?
- Hey, let's skip club stuff
today and catch a movie.

253,Taki
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,850
Uh...

254,Tsukasa
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,710
Taaaki!

255,Tsukasa
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,660
Can't believe you got in at noon.
Come on, let's grab lunch!

256,Tsukasa
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,250
You ignored my text, too!

257,Taki+Tsukasa
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,380
- Mr. Tsukasa.
- "Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

258,Shinta+Taki
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,870
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

259,Shinta
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,030
Wait a second. How'd you wind up
getting lost on the way to school?

260,Taki
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,110
Uh...

261,Taki+Shinta
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,900
-Well, a girl-
-A girl?

262,Taki
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,870
A gal-

263,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,600
- Hm?
- Hm?

264,Taki
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,500
I mean...

265,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,390
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

266,Taki
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,400
A guy...

267,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,120
- [Nod]
- [Nod]

268,Taki
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,830
Y'know, guys just wanna have fun. Every day's a
festival when you're living in Tokyo... as a guy.

269,Shinta
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,160
Hey, you... sound funny.

270,Tsukasa
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,260
-And where's your lunch?

271,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,950
- Seriously?
- What is up with you?

272,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,370
- We could share somethin'.
- Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

273,Crowd
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,310
-Yes! Hahahaha!

274,Taki
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,730
Ah...

275,Taki
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,410
Thank you!

276,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,190
- Wanna hit the café later?
- Oh, that one? Sure.

277,Tsukasa
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,000
-You in, Taki?

278,Taki
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,080
-What? What?! WHAT?!

279,Taki
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,360
A café?!

280,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,580
- They've got nice timberwork in here.
- Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

281,Tsukasa
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,720
Taki, all set?

282,Taki
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,630
Uh...[Gasp]

283,Taki
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,860
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

284,Shinta
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,900
-Uh... maybe a decade ago.

285,Taki
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,850
-Hmmm...

286,Taki
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

287,Taki
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,880
Dreams are great!

288,Taki
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Huh?

289,Taki
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,970
Wha? Oh no! I think that I'm late for work.

290,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,260
- You got a shift today?
- Guess you better get goin'.

291,Taki
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,460
Right.

292,Taki
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,710
Sorry, but uh...

293,Taki
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,470
Where exactly do I work?

294,Shinta+Tsukasa
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,910
- Wha?
- Wha?

295,Kitchen
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,430
- Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!
- Table twelve! Taki!

296,Taki
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,490
Got it!

297,Taki
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,020
Here you go.

298,Taki
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,250
So, the zucchini and tomato
salad with a side of...

299,Customers+Taki
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
- We didn't order that!
- Wha?

300,Kitchen
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,320
- Taki! I told you that
we are out of truffles!
- Taki, you gotta talk louder!

301,Kitchen
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,500
Taki!

302,Taki
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,940
When is this nightmare gonna be over?!

303,Customers
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,500
Diner: Waiter.

304,Customers+Taki
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,080
- Hey, you.
- Uh, yes?

305,Customers
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,420
See this? Does it look right?
A toothpick's in it.

306,Customers
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,420
What would have happened if we ate it?

307,Customers
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,370
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

308,Customers+Taki
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,790
-Do something.
-Uh... it's just that...

309,Taki
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,770
Well, I don't even think
we have toothpicks at this-

310,Customers
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,820
What?!

311,Okudera
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,450
Excuse me. Is everything alright over here?

312,Customers+Okudera
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,760
- Well, like I was trying to tell the guy...
- I'll take care of this.

313,Staff
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,420
What's wrong with you today?

314,Okudera
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,690
We truly apologize.
Your meal is on the house tonight.

315,Customers
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,840
Why, thank you.

316,Okudera
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,490
You weren't hurt, were you?

317,Taki+Staff
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,710
- Uh... Oku... dera?
- That's "Miss" to you.

318,Taki+Okudera
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,740
-Miss Okudera. About before-
-We just had some bad luck is all.

319,Taki+Okudera
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,260
-No, I- I-
-Those guys were definitely scamming us.

320,Okudera
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,330
I handled it according to the
manual, but still...

321,Staff
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,570
Uh-Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

322,Staff
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,000
- Are you alright?
- Did something happen?

323,Staff
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Looks like someone cut it.

324,Okudera
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,910
That guy...

325,Staff
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,910
- Do you remember what he looked like?
- No...

326,Taki+Staff
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,750
- Come with me.
- Hey, Taki.

327,Taki
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,730
Okay, take off your skirt.

328,Okudera
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,590
What?!

329,Taki
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,360
N- wh- I'll... I'll look the other way!

330,Taki
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,850
Hold on, this won't take long.

331,Taki
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,520
All done! Ta-da!

332,Okudera
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,510
You're really good, Taki!
It's way cuter now!

333,Taki
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,620
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

334,Okudera
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,000
To be honest, well...
I was worried about you.

335,Okudera
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You aren't that strong,
but you're quick to pick a fight.

336,Okudera
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
I like you better today.

337,Okudera
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,720
You've got a feminine side.
Who woulda guessed?

338,None
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
"JR Yamanote Line: 7 min."

339,Taki
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,220
I gotta say,
this dream sure does seem real.

340,Taki
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,080
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

341,Taki
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,990
So organized.

342,Taki
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,490
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

343,Taki
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,670
One of her.

344,Taki
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,830
Unrequited love?

345,None
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,540
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

346,None
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,380
"Who are you?"

347,None 
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,790
"Mitsuha"

348,Taki
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,380
What is this?

349,None
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,380
"Mitsuha"

350,Taki
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,810
Wha?!

351,Taki
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,300
What?!

352,None
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,750
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

353,Taki
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,200
What is going on?!

354,Shinta
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,140
So, café today?

355,Taki
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,530
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

356,Tsukasa
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,700
Ha, do you remember where to go?

357,Taki
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,680
Huh?...Ah!

358,Tsukasa
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,740
Wait a second. Was that you, Tsukasa? Are you
the one that's been messing with my phone?

359,Taki
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,370
Uh... Never mind.

360,Taki
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,120
Later.

361,Shinta
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
Well, he's back to normal.

362,Tsukasa
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,440
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

363,Taki
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,420
Uhhhhh....

364,Taki
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,160
Uh... what's up?

365,Staff
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,480
Don't play dumb.
What about bro code, huh?!

366,Staff
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah, you walked home
with her yesterday, right?

367,Taki
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,630
Uh, what are you talking about?
Me and Ms. Okudera?

368,Staff
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,310
- So what did you guys do?!
- So what did you guys do?!
- So what did you guys do?!

369,Taki
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,630
Uh, well... I don't remember, actually.

370,Staff
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,610
Quit messin' around and tell us!

371,Okudera
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,540
Okudera, reporting for duty!

372,Okudera+Staff
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,400
-Don't slack off today, you guys.
We're gonna have a good day today.
-Yeah...

373,Okudera
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,780
Aren't we, Taki?

374,Staff
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,900
Hmmm?

375,None
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,400
"Mitsuha? Who are you?? What are you??"

376,Yotsuha
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,900
Yotsuha: I see you're not touching
your boobies today.

377,Yotsuha
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,980
Breakfast time! Hurry up!

378,Mitsuha
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,050
MY BOOBS?!

379,Mitsuha
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,640
Mornin'!

380,Mitsuha
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,220
I feel like everyone's
starin' at me for some reason.

381,Saya+Mitsuha
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,680
- Well you did kinda make a scene yesterday.
- Uh?!

382,None
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,150
"Still-life drawing"

383,StudentB
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,320
-Did you see all the election posters?

384,StudentA
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,490
-Doesn't matter who wins, nothin'll
change, 'cept for who gets the kickback.

385,StudentB
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,010
-Shhh! Somebody's daddy's dependent on it.

386,Taki
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,080
-They're talking about me, right?

387,Saya
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,460
Uh... [Nod]

388,Mitsuha
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,740
Wait, Mitsuha?!

389,Mitsuha
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,020
I... I...

390,Mitsuha
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,220
I did what?!

391,Yotsuha
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,220
Mitsuha?

392,None
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,520
"What is this life?"

393,Mitsuha
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,730
Could this... could this mean-

394,Taki
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,030
-No, no, no, no! Could this mean...
that we're really-

395,Mitsuha
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,400
That we're...
in our dreams, that guy and I-

396,Taki
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,430
That we're...
in our dreams, that girl and I-

397,None
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,040
"Life in Tokyo"

398,None
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,040
"What is this life?"

399,Taki+Mitsuha
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,540
- We're switching places?!
- We're switching places?!

400,Band
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,140
At last, hello, you've opened your eyes,

401,Band
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,690
but why won't you even look me in the eyes,
what's wrong with you?

402,Band
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,250
You angrily tell me that I'm late.

403,Band
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,990
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace!

404,Mitsuha
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,740
Mitsuha: I'm slowly beginning to
realize what's going on.

405,Mitsuha
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,200
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

406,Taki
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,490
Taki: Two or three times a week, I'll suddenly and randomly
switch with Mitsuha, who's somewhere out in the boonies.

407,Taki
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,540
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

408,None
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,990
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"

409,Mitsuha
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,390
Mitsuha: Any memories I have of the switch
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

410,Taki
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,450
Taki: But there's no doubt that
we're switching places.

411,Taki
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,150
The reactions of everyone
around us prove it.

412,Taki
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,620
And that's why...

413,Mitsuha
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,730
Mitsuha: That's why we decided to lay out some ground
rules so we could protect each other's way of life.

414,None
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,040
"Strictly forbidden!"

415,None
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,130
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

416,Mitsuha 
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,530
Things to watch out for during the switches,
and a list of stuff we should never do.

417,None
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,470
"Don't waste money!
No dialect! Don't be late!"

418,Taki
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,160
Taki: We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places...

419,Mitsuha
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,560
Mitsuha: So that we can work together to get
through this... weird thing that's happening.

420,Mitsuha
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,570
-And yet...

421,Taki
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,030
-And yet...

422,Mitsuha+Taki
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,520
- I cannot believe this guy!
- I cannot believe this girl!

423,Band
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,100
Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,

424,Band
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
been looking everywhere for you.

425,Band
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,590
I followed the sound of
your innocent laughter,

426,Band
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,690
and it guided me in the right way.

427,Band
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,210
Even if every piece of you disappeared

428,Band
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,450
and if it scattered everywhere...

429,Mitsuha
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,110
Mitsuha: Guys will stare. Watch the skirt!

430,Mitsuha
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,810
These are basics for a girl!

431,None
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,950
"Careful with skirts!"

432,Taki+Mitsuha
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,410
Taki: Stop wasting my money on sweets!
Mitsuha: It's goin' in your body.
Plus, I also worked for that money.

433,None
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,300
"Braided Cords..."

434,Taki
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,070
Taki: Braiding cords is impossible!

435,Mitsuha+Taki
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,660
Mitsuha: You work way too many shifts!
Taki: 'Cause you keep wasting money!

436,Band
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,210
I wonder if we can push our way through

437,Band
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,910
the countless barrier that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view.

438,Band
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,420
Side-by-side, no way we can lose.

439,Band
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,520
We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules.

440,Mitsuha
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,700
Mitsuha: Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the
way home. You two have a good thing going!

441,Taki
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,210
Taki: Quit messing with my
relationships, Mitsuha!

442,Mitsuha
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,850
-Hey, Taki... why is a girl
confessing her love to me?

443,Taki
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,350
-Maybe you're just more
popular when I'm you.

444,Mitsuha
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,490
-You're so full of yourself!
Like you have a girlfriend!

445,None
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,360
"Don't be so full of yourself!!"

446,Taki
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,970
-It's not like you have anyone, either!

447,Taki+Mitsuha
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,720
- I don't...
- I don't...

448,None
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,530
"Dummy"

449,None
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,530
"Idiot"

450,Mitsuha+Taki
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,870
- Because I don't want a relationship!
- Because I don't want a relationship!

451,Taki
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,210
I shouldn't for her sake.

452,Yotsuha
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,710
Yotsuha: You sure do like your own boobies.

453,Yotsuha
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,960
Time to go! Get ready!

454,TV
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,810
Over the course of the last few days, the Tiamat comet
has been visible, but when and where can people see it?

455,None
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,250
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

456,TV
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:26,980
The Tiamat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does: from East to West from our point of view.

457,Yotsuha
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,310
Why are you wearin' your uniform?

458,Yotsuha
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,370
Yotsuha: Grandma, why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

459,Grandma
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,830
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

460,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,420
- Who's Mayugoro?
- What? He's famous!

461,Mitsuha
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,340
Hop on, grandma.

462,Yotsuha+Mitsuha
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,780
- Oh!
- Watch out! Careful!

463,Grandma
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,070
Mitsuha. Yotsuha. Do you know about Musubi?

464,Mitsuha
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,200
Mu... subi?

465,Grandma
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,060
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago, and it means "union".

466,Grandma
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,300
This word has profound meaning.

467,Grandma
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Tying strings together is a union, connecting to
people is a union, and the flow of time is a union.

468,Grandma
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:47,710
These are all part of the god's power. The
braided cords that we make are tied to that.

469,Grandma
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,270
A skill from the god,
they represent the flow of time itself.

470,Grandma
00:34:53,970 --> 00:35:01,940
They assemble and take shape. They twist,
tangle, unravel now and then, break...

471,Grandma
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,050
and reconnect.

472,Grandma
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,240
That's what a union is. What time is.

473,Grandma+Mitsuha
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,080
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

474,Yotsuha+Grandma
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,100
- I want some, too!
- That's also a union.

475,Grandma
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:26,310
Whether it's water, rice or sake, when something
becomes a part of a person, it's a union.

476,Grandma
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,960
It joins their soul, which is why the offering
we're making today is such an important custom.

477,Grandma
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,350
It connects the god with people.

478,Yotsuha
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,110
Hey, I can see it!

479,Mitsuha
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,980
This is where it is.
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

480,Grandma
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:10,490
What lies ahead is the hereafter.
It's the netherworld.

481,Yotsuha
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,360
The netherworld!

482,Grandma
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:23,170
In order to return to this world, you have to
leave behind what is most important to you.

483,Grandma
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,380
Like the kuchikamizake.

484,Mitsuha
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,230
Kuchikamizake?

485,Grandma
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:37,160
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine
god's relic. After all, it is half of you.

486,Mitsuha
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,670
Half... of Mitsuha.

487,Yotsuha
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,010
Wow, it's already magic hour!

488,Mitsuha
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,010
Magic hour?

489,Yotsuha+Mitsuha
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,730
- Oh, yeah! Maybe I can see the comet!
- Huh? The comet?

490,Grandma
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,490
Oh, Mitsuha...

491,Grandma
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,990
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

492,Taki
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,950
I'm crying? But why?

493,None
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,510
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

494,Taki
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,820
Ms. Okudera? She's almost where?

495,Taki
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh, Mitsuha. What did you do?

496,Taki
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,480
Date?!

497,Mitsuha
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,300
Mitsuha: "Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Ms.
Okudera."

498,None
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,090
"Meet up at the station at 10:30!"

499,Mitsuha
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,020
Well, that's what I had planned, but...

500,Okudera+Taki
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,790
- Hi, Taki.
- Huh? Agh!

501,Okudera+Taki
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,620
- Wait long?
- Yeah. Aah-no! Uh...

502,Taki+Okudera
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,110
- I just got here.
- Thank goodness. Let's go!

503,Mitsuha
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,090
Must be nice.
They've probably met up about now.

504,Mitsuha
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,880
Huh?

505,Mitsuha
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,740
Why am I...?

506,Mitsuha
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,070
Why...?

507,Mitsuha
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,700
"It was a date I wanted to go on, but if it so happens that
you end up goin', you better be grateful and enjoy it!"

508,Taki
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:27,780
This is nice! It's my first time here.
So, is this one of your usual go-to spots?

509,Mitsuha
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,270
Mitsuha: "At any rate, I bet you've
never even been on a single date."

510,Taki
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,270
No way, it's too expensive!

511,Taki
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,230
I don't know what to say to her.

512,Mitsuha
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,900
"That's why I've handpicked some links
below to help you out, ya wallflower!"

513,Taki
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,940
For real?

514,None
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,370
"You, too, can get a girlfriend!"

515,None
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,830
"Despite social anxiety, I got a girl!"
"The dos and don'ts of texting!"

516,Taki
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,370
She's making fun of me!

517,None
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,390
"Photo Exhibition: Nostalgia"

518,Okudera
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,960
You know something, Taki?

519,Okudera
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,230
Today, you're...
you're like a different person.

520,Taki
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:37,810
Ms. Okudera. You getting hungry?
We could get dinner.

521,Okudera+Taki
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,630
- Uh... let's call it a day.
- U-uh... Alright.

522,Okudera+Taki
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,470
- I could be wrong, and I'm sorry if I am...
- About?

523,Okudera
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,410
But you used to have a
little crush on me, am I right?

524,Okudera
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,070
But right now,
there's someone else you like, huh?

525,Taki+Okudera
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,760
- N-n-no! U-uh-it's not that...
- Really?

526,Taki+Okudera
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,190
- There's no one. It's not like that.
- Are you sure about that?

527,Okudera
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,040
Well, thanks for today. See you at work!

528,Taki
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,750
Taki: By the time the date's over,

529,Taki+Mitsuha
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,190
-you should be able to
see the comet in the sky.
-"...you should be able to
see the comet in the sky."

530,Taki
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,710
What does she mean? Weirdo.

531,Mitsuha
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,130
-Oh.

532,Mitsuha
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,820
Mitsuha: It's you, Teshi.

533,Mitsuha
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,520
No. I just didn't feel like
goin', that's all. I'm fine.

534,Mitsuha
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,610
What? The festival?

535,Mitsuha
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,440
Ah...

536,Mitsuha
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,250
Oh yeah, the comet.
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

537,Mitsuha
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,490
Okay, got it. Seeya later!

538,Saya
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,600
You're just looking forward to seeing
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

539,Teshi
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,340
I- I am not!

540,Teshi
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

541,Teshi+Mitsuha
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,730
- Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.
- Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

542,Teshi
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,120
It's not funny!

543,Mitsuha+Teshi+Saya
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,450
- Sorry to keep ya.
- Oh, she's here!
- You're late!

544,Saya+Teshi
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,060
- [Gasp]
- [Gasp]

545,Saya+Teshi
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,110
- Mitsuha, what happened to-?
- [Gasp]

546,Teshi
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,070
-Your hair!

547,Mitsuha
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,200
I guess... it's weird.

548,Teshi
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,120
You think it's gotta do with some guy.
Like, he broke her heart?

549,Saya
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,480
Guys always just assume that
it has to do with a boy.

550,Saya+Teshi
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,370
- She said she felt like cuttin' it.
- Ya sure about that? You really think she
felt like cuttin' off that much of it?

551,Mitsuha
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,750
Hey guys, I can see it!

552,Mitsuha+Saya+Teshi
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,400
- Whoa, ho-ho!
- Whoa...
- Ah.

553,Mitsuha
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,590
Huh?

554,Phone
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,780
Phone: "The number you are trying to reach is currently
outside the cellular network or has been turned off due-"

555,Taki
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,320
Taki: I'll just have to tell her how lousy
the date ended up the next time we switch.

556,Taki
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,630
That's what I thought.

557,Taki
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,430
But, for some reason,

558,Taki
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,630
the switches Mitsuha and I had
been going through until now...

559,Taki
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,400
they never happened again.

560,None
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,080
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

561,None

"Hida Mountains"

562,Taki
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,560
Wha-

563,Taki
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,940
What are-

564,Taki
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,530
What are you doing here?

565,Okudera
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,580
Okudera: Tsukasa told me about it, so here I am.

566,Taki
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,900
I asked for two things: to cover my shift
and to back up my alibi if my dad asked.

567,Tsukasa
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,980
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

568,Takagi
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,400
Takagi: Gotch'a covered!

569,Takagi
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,350
But you owe me dinner.

570,Taki+Tsukasa
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,600
- So, you're all in on it...
- You've got everyone worried about you.

571,Taki+Tsukasa
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,700
- Huh?
- We can't ignore this! What if somebody's
trying to pull one over on you?

572,Taki
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,850
Like catfish?

573,Okudera
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,330
I mean, you met this person
online, didn't you?

574,Taki
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,800
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

575,Tsukasa
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,860
- Could be from a dating site-
- She's NOT!

576,Tsukasa
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,610
It's because you've been acting awfully
fishy lately, so we're keeping an eye on you.

577,Taki
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,320
I don't need a babysitter, okay!

578,Taki
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,980
Taki: The switches stopped, my calls never
connected, and texts never went through.

579,Taki
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,690
That's why I decided to
go see Mitsuha in person.

580,Taki
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,680
I wanted to see her, but...

581,Okudera
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,730
-What? You don't know where she is exactly?
The town's landscape is your only clue?

582,Taki
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,740
Yeah.

583,Okudera
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,410
And you can't contact her?
What's that about?

584,Taki+Tsukasa
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,990
-Where are we?
You're a terrible tour guide-
-'Cause I'm not one!

585,Okudera
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,570
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

586,Okudera+Taki
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,230
- Aww, it's so cute! Look, Taki!
- Seriously, guys?

587,Okudera
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,600
Okudera: It moved! Awww!

588,Taki
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,410
Taki: This is a lost cause.

589,Okudera+Tsukasa
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,530
- What?!
- What?!

590,Okudera
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,500
After everything that
we've done for you today?!

591,Taki
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,650
You haven't done anything!

592,Okudera+Tsukasa
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,980
- One Takayama Ramen.

593,Taki
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,500
I guess I'll have the same.

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,840
Sure.

595,Waitress+Chef
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,310
Waitress: Three orders of ramen.
Chef: Got it.

596,Taki+Tsukasa
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,410
- Think we can make it
back to Tokyo tonight?
- Well, I think we'll be cuttin' it close.

597,Tsukasa
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,540
Let me take a look.

598,Taki+Okudera
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,180
- K, thanks.
- Wait, Taki. You sure about that?

599,Taki
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,030
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

600,Waitress
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,190
Hey, that's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

601,Waitress
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,690
It's drawn really well.

602,Waitress
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,070
Come take a look at this, hon!

603,Chef
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,040
Yeah, that's Itomori. Takes me back.

604,Waitress
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,630
My husband was born and raised
there, you know.

606,Taki
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,630
Yes, of course! That's the place!
It's nearby, right?

You don't...?

615,Tsukasa
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,190
Tsukasa: No way. Taki must have just
confused this with somewhere else.

616,Taki
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,300
Taki: No, I didn't.

617,Taki

This was the place.

There's no way you could.

622,Tsukasa

disaster three years ago, right?

623,Tsukasa+Taki
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,050
- Hundreds of people died.
- They died...

He's still reading articles on Itomori.

664,Tsukasa
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,890
He's goin' through all those newspapers

I mean, he was a nice guy
before, but he's even nicer now.

Kind-of... frantic.

telling us is definitely strange-sounding.

00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,490
That's what a union is.

726,Taki
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,920
What time is.

727,Taki
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,370
There it is.

728,Taki
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,990
It's really there!

729,Taki
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,080
It wasn't...

730,Taki
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,380
a dream.

731,Taki
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,990
What lies ahead is the netherworld.

732,Taki
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,690
It's still here.

733,Taki
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,380
This was Yotsuha's, and this was mine.

734,Taki
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,270
This was before the comet.

735,Taki
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,980
So when I switched places with her,

736,Taki
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,010
it was also three years in the past.

737,Taki
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,020
Our times... got tangled somehow.

738,Taki
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,580
This is... half of her.

739,Taki
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,970
Musubi,

740,Taki
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:36,020
if it's true, and time can be unraveled,

741,Taki
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:39,070
just give me one more chance.

742,Taki
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,940
Agh!

743,Taki
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,780
[Gasp]

744,Taki
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,000
A comet!

ngh! Hh...

- [Crying]
- Your name's going to be...

748,Futaba
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,180
Mitsuha.

749,Toshiki
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,040
Both of you are my treasures.

750,Futaba
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,140
You're going to be a big sister!

751,None
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,790
"Get well soon, Mom!"

752,MitsuhaMom
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,310
I'm so sorry, my dears...

753,Yotsuha
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,980
Dad, when is mommy coming home?

754,Toshiki+Grandma
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,080
- I couldn't help her!
- Get ahold of yourself!

755,Toshiki+Grandma
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,350
- Who cares about the shrine?!
- But you're in charge now!

756,Toshiki+Grandma
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:35,260
- I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine!
- Get out!

757,Grandma
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,540
Now listen to me, girls.

758,Grandma
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,980
Starting today,
you'll be living with grandma.

759,Mitsuha
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,430
"Who are you?"

760,Mitsuha
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,800
"Who am I?" Who are you?

761,Mitsuha
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,680
"Mitsuha"

762,Mitsuha
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,780
"Idiot"

763,Mitsuha
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,290
Don't be full of yourself!

764,Mitsuha
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,380
Like you have a girlfriend!

765,Mitsuha
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,800
Must be nice.

766,Mitsuha
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,310
They've probably met up about now.

767,Mitsuha
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,830
Why am I...?

768,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:06,090
- I'm going to Tokyo.
- What?! Wait, Sis!

769,Mitsuha
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,050
Grandma?

770,Mitsuha
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:12,080
Would you mind doing me a favor?

771,Mitsuha
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,100
Oh yeah, the comet.

772,Mitsuha
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,170
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

773,Taki
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,570
-Mitsuha, don't go there!

774,Taki
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,620
Mitsuha!

775,Taki
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,070
You've gotta get out of town
before the comet strikes!

01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,980
She's alive!

01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,350
Yotsuha: Ungh!

01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,670
[Shudder]

789,Yotsuha
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,170
I think she's finally lost it.

790,Yotsuha
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:27,540
Just for today,
I-I'm gonna head out first...

791,Yotsuha
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,860
She's lost it...

792,Yotsuha
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,070
Really lost it...

793,Yotsuha
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,410
Totally!

794,Yotsuha
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,660
Totally...

795,TV
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:38,410
-For all you stargazers out there, the comet Tiamat
has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

796,TV
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:44,770
Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 PM (19:40),
and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's...

797,Mitsuha
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,730
It's tonight! There's still time left!

798,Grandma
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,220
Mornin', Mitsuha!

799,Grandma
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,510
What's this?

800,Grandma
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,850
Hold on...

801,Grandma+Mitsuha
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,690
- You're not Mitsuha, are you?
- W-wait, how did you-?

802,Mitsuha
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,170
You already knew?

803,Grandma
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:07,200
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

804,Gradnma
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,890
When I was a young girl,

805,Grandma
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:13,010
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

806,Mitsuha
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,810
Huh?

807,Grandma
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:20,710
Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became
in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

808,Mitsuha
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,940
Faded?

809,Grandma
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,230
Treasure the experience.
Dreams eventually will fade away.

810,Grandma
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:30,050
I went through similar times myself,

811,Grandma
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,700
and so did your mother.

812,Mitsuha
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,310
What if...

813,Mitsuha
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,960
all those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had!

814,Mitsuha
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,300
It had to do with today!

815,Mitsuha
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,720
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

816,Mitsuha
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,490
Tonight,

817,Mitsuha
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,800
the comet is going to fall on Itomori!

818,Mitsuha+Grandma
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,190
- You're all gonna die!
- Huh?

819,Mitsuha
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,390
"Nobody's gonna believe that?"

820,Mitsuha
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:00,340
I didn't expect that out
of Mitsuha's grandma.

821,Mitsuha
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,270
It doesn't matter!
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

822,Saya
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,280
Mitsuha!

823,Saya
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,820
What happened... to-?

824,Teshi
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,550
What'd you-?

825,Teshi
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,520
Your hair!

826,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,000
-Ugh, the haircut?
Looked better before, huh?
-No, i-i-it's good!

827,Mitsuha
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,690
Nevermind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

828,Mitsuha
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,400
It's up to us to save everyone!

829,Shopkeeper
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,410
Wait, shouldn't you be in school?

830,Saya
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:36,120
Well, we sort-of have to save the
town, or something.

831,Shopkeeper
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Heh?

832,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,380
- The warning system?
- Yeah, those speakers all over the town.

833,None
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,890
"Superimposition, frequency"

834,Mitsuha
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,280
I get it. It could work!

835,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,540
- Niiiice job, Teshi.
- Hey, I don't think you should
be sittin' so close to me.

836,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:56,150
- What's wrong. Uh-oh! You shyyy?
- Would you quit it?!

837,Teshi
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,400
It ain't proper and you know it!

838,None
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,880
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

839,Mitsuha
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,830
Taki (as Mitsuha): T-hahahahaha!

840,Mitsuha
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,130
Such a gentleman.

841,Saya
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,000
I bought all the snacks, guys.

842,Saya+Mitsuha
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,470
- Here's the change.
- Sorry for the trouble.

843,Saya
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,470
I didn't mind.

844,Teshi+Mitsuha
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,660
- We oughta be gettin' paid.
- Quit complaining.

845,Saya
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,670
So? Wha'dcha come up with?

846,Saya
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,080
Got an evacuation plan?

847,Saya
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:24,610
A- A-

848,Saya
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,020
A BOMB?!

849,Teshi
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,370
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

850,Saya
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,010
AND the warning system?

851,Teshi
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,150
Our startup frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily,

852,Mitsuha
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:41,340
so we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

853,Mitsuha
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,690
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

854,Mitsuha
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,460
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

855,Saya
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,770
It's-

856,Saya+Mistuha
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,970
- It's totally a crime!
- You'll be in charge
of the broadcast, Saya.

857,Saya+Teshi
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,460
- Why me?!
- You're in the Broadcast Club.

858,Teshi+Mitsuha
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,250
- And I'll be in charge of the explosives.
- While I go have a word with the mayor.

859,Saya+Teshi
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,140
- Why?
- 'Cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from Town Hall, then nobody's gonna go anyway.

860,Mitsuha
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,470
But if I talk to the mayor,
as his daughter, I can convince him.

861,Saya
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,120
It's the perfect plan!

862,Saya
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,300
Fine, I don't really care
one way or the other.

863,Saya
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,190
This is just a theory of yours, right?

864,Teshi
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,810
Well...

865,Teshi
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:21,590
Theories can be based on reality. Like, do you know the
story of how Itomori Lake was formed? It's a crater!

866,None
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,750
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

867,Teshi+Mitsuha
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:28,090
- That means a meteor hit this area
at least once a thousand years ago!
- Right. That's why-!

868,Mitsuha
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:29,890
Nice one, Teshi!

869,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,520
- Let's go evacuate the town!
- Let's go evacuate the town!

870,Toshiki
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,710
Mitsuha's Father: What on earth
are you talking about?!

871,Mitsuha
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,040
Like I said,

872,Toshiki+Mitsuha
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,000
-We have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or else-
-Enough! Shut up!

873,Toshiki

"The comet's going to split
in two and strike the town?"

874,None

"Itomori Town Hall"

875,Toshiki

"Over 500 will die?"

876,Toshiki
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,620
How dare you stand there
and spout such nonsense!

877,Toshiki
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:08,030
If you're serious, you must be sick!

878,Toshiki
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:12,000
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

879,Toshiki
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:16,450
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

880,Toshiki
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:20,380
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

881,Mitsuha
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,880
You!

882,Mitsuha
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:28,010
You son of a- !

883,Toshiki
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,000
Mitsuha's Father: Mitsuha...

884,Toshiki
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,390
No...

885,Toshiki
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,410
Wait a minute...

886,Toshiki
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,590
Who are you?

887,Kids
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,950
-I'll see you guys at the festival, ba-bye!
-We'll meet ya at the step stone shrine.
Don't be late, k?

888,Kids
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,910
- Ba-bye!
- Seeya!
- Later!

889,Mitsuha
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,710
You shouldn't go!

890,Mitsuha+Kids
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:11,880
-You've got to leave town!
Tell all of your friends!
-What's wrong with you?!

891,Yotsuha+Mitsuha+Kids
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,300
- Mitsuha!
- What was that about?
- Come on, let's go.

892,Yotsuha
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,700
What are you doing, huh?

893,Mitsuha
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,030
If it was Mitsuha,

894,Mitsuha
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,320
would she have been able to convince him?

895,Mitsuha
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,190
- Is all this my fault?!
- Huh?!

896,Mitsuha
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:27,930
Yotsuha, promise me that you'll
leave town with grandma before dark!

897,Yotsuha
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:28,570
What?!

898,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,670
- You're gonna die if you stay here!
- What are you talking about?!

899,Yotsuha
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:37,530
And why did you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?!
You've been acting really strange lately!

900,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,750
- Went to Tokyo?
- Hey! Mitsuha!

901,Teshi
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,960
How'd it go with your old man?

902,Teshi
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:51,250
Hey, Mitsuha!

903,Teshi
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,900
What's with your sister?

904,Yotsuha
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,280
Don't know.

905,None
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,510
[Ding]

906,Mitsuha
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,410
Could she be over there?

907,Sara
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,890
What's that? What's over there?

908,Mitsuha+Teshi
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:12,030
- Let me use your bike, Teshi.
- Hey.

909,Teshi
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,040
Mitsuha.

910,Teshi
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,060
And what do we do?

911,Mitsuha
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,200
Get things ready like we planned!

912,Mitsuha
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,930
I'm counting on you!

913,Taki
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,010
Mitsuha: Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again!

914,Taki
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,630
What's Taki doin' out here?

915,Taki
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,480
The town!

916,Taki
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,370
It's gone!

917,Taki
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:18,000
So...

918,Taki
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,000
does that mean...

919,Taki
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,910
I... died?!

920,Mitsuha
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,710
"Taki."

921,Mitsuha
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:39,020
"Taki!"

922,Mitsuha
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,800
"Don't you remember?!"

923,Mitsuha
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,550
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

924,Yotsuha
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,370
Wha? Right now?

925,Mitsuha+Yotsuha
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,800
- But why?
- Uh...

926,Mitsuha
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,210
For a date.

927,Yotsuha+Mitsuha
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,320
- You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!
- I-I didn't say it was a date for me.

928,Mitsuha
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,000
"I'll be back tonight."

929,Mitsuha
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,000
Mitsuha: If I suddenly show up, will it
be a nuisance or a surprise?

930,Mitsuha
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
He might not like it if I do.

is currently outside the cellular network."

01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,620
I guess it won't happen, but...

933,Mitsuha
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,640
What if it did?

934,Mitsuha
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,590
What would I do?

935,Mitsuha
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,640
Would I annoy him?

Closest Approach Tomorrow"

937,Mitsuha

Would it be awkward, or maybe...

938,Mitsuha
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,990
he'd be glad to see me.

01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,870
I guess we won't meet.

941,Mitsuha
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:01,860
But... there's one thing I'm certain of.

942,Mitsuha
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,520
If we see each other,

943,Mitsuha
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,320
We'll definitely know right away...

944,Mitsuha
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,530
that you were the one who was in me,

945,Mitsuha
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,800
and that I was the one who was in...

946,Mitsuha
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,550
- you.
- Sorry!

three years ago.

Mitsuha: [Whispering] Taki...

Taki?

- Taki!
- Huh?

Uh... It's me!

Sorry, who are you?

I- I'm sorry.

Ah!

Mitsuha!

you showed up.

Even Tokyo. It might vanish too one day.

And so, I wanna make landscapes

01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:13,410
has made it here before the rest has.

1321,Taki
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,730
Taki: Excuse me!

1322,Taki
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:30,350
Haven't we...?

1323,Taki
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,250
Have I...

1324,Taki
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,970
met you somewhere?

1325,Mitsuha
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,690
Mitsuha: I thought so, too!

1326,Mitsuha+Taki
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:49,230
- Can I ask you...
- Can I ask you...

1327,Mitsuha+Taki
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,680
- your name?
- your name?

1328,Band
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:57,180
The sorrowful gust of wind that
blew right between you and me,

1329,Band
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:02,920
where did it find the loneliness
it carried on the breeze?

1330,Band
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:08,680
Looking up at the sky after
shedding a stream of tears,

1331,Band
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:14,290
I could see for miles of blue,
it's never been so clear.

1332,Band
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:31,430
Speeches that my father gave me
would always make me despair.

1333,Band
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:37,050
Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today.

1334,Band
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:42,830
Your ever kind heart, the way you smile,
and even how you find your dreams.

1335,Band
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:48,330
I knew nothing, so honestly,
I've always copied you.

1336,Band
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:50,810
Now, just a little more,

1337,Band
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:54,070
only just a little more.

1338,Band
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:58,690
Let's stay here a little longer now.

1339,Band
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,310
Now just a little more,

1340,Band
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:05,510
only just a little more.

1341,Band
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:10,100
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

1342,Band
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,510
Oh yes, we are time fliers

1343,Band
01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:19,390
scaling the walls of time. Climber

1344,Band
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:24,080
tired of playing hide-and-seek
with time and

1345,Band
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,180
always comin' dead short.

1346,Band
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,870
Crying even when you're happy,

1347,Band
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:30,500
smiling even when you're feeling lonely.

1348,Band
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:35,240
It's because a part of you has
made it here before the rest has.

1349,Band
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:02,830
I used to wish upon the stars,
the toys that I once adored.

1350,Band
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:08,780
Forgotten now, are rollin'
'round the corners of the floor.

1351,Band
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:14,390
Finally, my dream has counted
up to a hundred today.

1352,Band
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:20,210
Someday, I'll trade them
all for just the very one.

1353,Band
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:31,650
Girl that I have seen in school,
that never have told "hello",

1354,Band
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:37,270
After class today, I waved and
said, “See you tomorrow!”

1355,Band
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:42,920
It's not really that bad trying
something new every once in a while,

1356,Band
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:48,420
especially if I can do
it with you by my side.

1357,Band
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,950
Now just a little more,

1358,Band
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:54,140
only just a little more.

1359,Band
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:59,020
Let's stay here a little longer now.

1360,Band
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,390
Just a little more,

1361,Band
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:05,610
only just a little more.

1362,Band
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:10,000
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

1363,Band
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:17,750
Oh yes, we are time fliers, so, and I...

1364,Band
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,630
I knew who you were way before...

1365,Band
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,790
way before I even knew my own name.

1366,Band
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:30,270
There's no clue, but I'm sure. I swear!

1367,Band
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:34,910
Even if you're not around
in this wide world,

1368,Band
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:37,740
of course it surely would
have some kind of meaning.

1369,Band
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:40,650
But if when you're not
around in this crazy world,

1370,Band
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,710
would be like the month of
August without summer break.

1371,Band
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:46,360
And if you're not around
in this great world,

1372,Band
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,610
would be like Santa Claus without any glee.

1373,Band
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:57,620
If you're not around in this wide world!

1374,Band
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:25,190
Oh yes, we are time fliers

1375,Band
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:28,130
scaling the walls of time. Climber

1376,Band
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:32,820
tired of playing hide-and-seek
with time and

1377,Band
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,910
always comin' dead short.

1378,Band
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,690
No, never mind that!

1379,Band
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,250
No, never mind what I said now,

1380,Band
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,300
'cause I'm on my way to you!

1381,Band
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,070
Oh, we are time fliers,

1382,Band
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:48,920
dashing up the steps of time now!

1383,Band
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,590
No more playing hide-and-seek
with you and time

1384,Band
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:55,670
and always comin' dead short!

1385,Band
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:57,500
You're quite a showy crier!

1386,Band
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,850
Wanna stop your tears,

1387,Band
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,350
see your eyes drier!

1388,Band
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:03,570
But when I went to wipe your tears dry,

1389,Band
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:07,130
you refused but I saw them pouring
down your face, I knew why!

1390,Band
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:08,820
Crying even when I'm happy,

1391,Band
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,440
smiling even when I'm feeling lonely!

1392,Band
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,430
It's because the heart of mine

1393,Band
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:17,170
has made it here before my body.
